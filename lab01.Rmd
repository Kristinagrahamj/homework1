*What happens when you surround text with one-star pairs?*

**What happens when you surround text with two-star pairs?**

***What happens when you surround text with three-star pairs?***

1.  Start typing this list. Note there are two spaces between the period 
    and the word "Start".
2.  Type the second line of the list
1.  What happens if I type step 3 as another step 1?

*   What does this star at the beginning do?
*   Visually, it's similar to the numbered list.

1.  What happens if we nest a list?
    1.  Type four spaces, then type the number
    2.  Did this do what you expected?
2.  What if we contine the numbers this way?
    *   What happens if we indent using stars?
    *   Let's add another one for good measure.
        *   Can we get another level of nesting?
